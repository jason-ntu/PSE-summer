Answer the following questions (in as much detail as you like).

## Homomorphic Hiding

1. Explain homomorphic hiding in your own words.

```
Hide the actual databy doing some operations on encrypted data and ensuring that the results would be the same as if we did the same operations on the unencrypted data first and then encrypted the result.
```

## Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS)

1. Describe the Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) in your own words.
2. Why is R1CS essential in the zkSNARK construction pipeline?

## Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP)

1. What is the primary goal of converting R1CS into a QAP?
2. How does QAP aid in the zkSNARK proof generation process?
3. Why are polynomials central to the QAP representation?

## The Pinocchio Protocol

1. Why is the Pinocchio Protocol considered a significant step towards practical zkSNARK construction?
